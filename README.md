### iOS Developer

#### üìç Buenos Aires, Argentina

I see app development as a way to convey facilitiy and productivity to final users.
I like to create modern applications, using the latest technologies or frameworks that help the language and facilitate development, without losing its power.
My goals are to grow professionally in environments where I can learn together with great professionals, building products that make an impact on the industry.
