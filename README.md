####¬†JR iOS Developer in process & Informatic Student at UNLP

In 2019 I decided to start studying computer science and get into one of my passions.
Actually I am on the 2nd year of the computer science degree, enjoying the road and learning more every day.

A year ago, in 2020, I started to introduce myself in the iOS apps world using Swift and XCode.
I have been learning by some Udemy courses and working on my own projects to gain experience.
